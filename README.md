# chemical Reaction Diffusion
a script to simulate the interaction of chemicals and the emergence of order using differential equations.
This is based on Alan Turings Chemical basis of morphogenesis paper, implemented with the gray scott model of reaction diffusion. The set parameters will produce striped but any slight modification can create new emergent behaviours such as spots. Some believe the behaviour explains animal patterns.
